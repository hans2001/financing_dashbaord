## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Draft the `filter-panel-density` spec summarizing the compact layout goals and scenarios
- [ ] 1.2 Reduce padding/gaps in `FiltersPanel` and refine the filter summary/chips layout to reclaim vertical space while keeping controls legible
- [ ] 1.3 Adjust the filter tray inputs and account selector so the expanded grid stays dense yet accessible
- [ ] 1.4 Add/adjust any relevant style helpers or tests ensuring the new compact spacing remains intentional
- [ ] 1.5 Run lint/tests that cover the dashboard layout (e.g., UI snapshots, form behavior) and note results

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Run `openspec validate refine-filter-panel-density --strict`
