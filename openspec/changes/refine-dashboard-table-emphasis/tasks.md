## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Adjust dashboard column sizing so the transactions table occupies the dominant width and the summary sidebar stays compact on xl screens.
- [ ] 1.2 Reduce summary card visual weight (padding, shadows, typography) so the sidebar reads as supplemental.
- [ ] 1.3 Increase table readability slightly (header/body sizing) while keeping compact density.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Add `openspec/changes/refine-dashboard-table-emphasis/specs/dashboard-layout/spec.md` with layout requirements and scenarios.
- [ ] 2.2 Run `openspec validate refine-dashboard-table-emphasis --strict`.
