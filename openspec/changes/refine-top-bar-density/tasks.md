## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Draft `top-bar-density` spec capturing compact header expectations and scenarios
- [ ] 1.2 Update dashboard layout to surface a more compact header (adjust spacing, typography, wordings, and CTA placement)
- [ ] 1.3 Ensure the new header still reuses shared components/hooks or introduces lightweight primitives as needed
- [ ] 1.4 Add or update tests/resources verifying the header layout tokens or semantics if possible
- [ ] 1.5 Run lint/tests relevant to the header changes and record results

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Run `openspec validate refine-top-bar-density --strict`
