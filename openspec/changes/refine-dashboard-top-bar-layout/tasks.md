## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Record the expected dashboard layout adjustments in `openspec/changes/refine-dashboard-top-bar-layout/specs/dashboard-layout/spec.md`.
- [ ] 1.2 Adjust `TopNavigation` so it renders the `LogoutButton` beside the Dashboard link without creating a separate call-to-action area.
- [ ] 1.3 Strip the `Family Dashboard` / `Finances` hero from `DashboardShell`, remove the extra top padding, and let the overview grid appear as close to the nav bar as possible.
- [ ] 1.4 Confirm the changes visually (or via story/test) to ensure padding and spacing behave as intended.
