## 1. Implementation
- [ ] Update the local CI runner to enable `act --reuse` by default.
- [ ] Add an opt-out mechanism for clean runs (environment variable).
- [ ] Document the default reuse behavior and how to disable it.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] Validate the local runner still executes the same workflow steps with reuse enabled.
