## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Extend dashboard filter hooks/state with `categoryFilter`, ensuring pagination reset + query params stay in sync.
- [ ] 1.2 Render the category selector UI (dropdown/tag) alongside existing filters and wire it to the new state.
- [ ] 1.3 Thread the category filter through the data-fetching layer and `/api/transactions` query logic.
- [ ] 1.4 Add/adjust component, hook, and API tests covering the new filter behavior and edge cases.
