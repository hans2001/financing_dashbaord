# Personal Finance Dashboard

This dashboard helps Hans and Yuki keep every household transaction and asset under one roof. It’s designed to:

- Surface spending and income trends across linked financial accounts,
- Make it easy to compare balance/activity in one place (saving the need to hop between bank portals),
- Offer actionable insights (top categories, averages, linked accounts) so the family stays ahead of their budget.

By syncing Plaid data and enabling manual tracking for supplemental sources, the app becomes a single source of truth for family finances (expenses, earners, and cross-border accounts). It’s also a sandbox-friendly way to rehearse how the wallet behaves before committing to production credentials.

See `TECHNICAL.md` for implementation details, setup, and commands.
